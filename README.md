## About program

It is a basic binary tree implementation in Go Lang. It saves number in branches, left side traverses to lower numbers and right side traverses for higher numbers

I did it in Scala and therefore wanted to do it in Go Lang as I love Go Lang as lot :-)

Nothing more to add. Program is self explanatory
